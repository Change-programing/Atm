    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    E4:33:C2:49:B0:96:D4:C3:87:FB:D5:F2:9F:5F:C3:B0:CB:88:FB:C4

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
